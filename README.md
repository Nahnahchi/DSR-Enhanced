# Sinners of Lordran
These are the project files for a Dark Souls REMASTERED overhaul mod called "Sinners of Lordran". This work is somewhat of an unofficial Definitive Edition of the game, it attempts to optimize in-game encounters, fix game-design inconsistencies/oversights and restore cut content.

This project was made using [soulstruct](https://github.com/Grimrukh/soulstruct).
It doesn't contain the edited TAE or sound files, which instead can be found inside the release.

Other tools used for this project:
* [dstools](https://github.com/katalash/dstools) for map-viewing.
* [DSAnimStudio](https://github.com/Meowmaritus/DSAnimStudio) for TAE editing.
* FMOD Designer v4.28.06 for sound event editing.
* [DSR-Gadget](https://github.com/JKAnderson/DSR-Gadget) for in-game testing.
* [DarkShell-R](https://github.com/Nahnahchi/dark-shell-R) for in-game testing (mainly spawning custom items).
