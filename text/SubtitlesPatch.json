        "12030100": "...I have waited for thee...",
        "12030101": "...Foolish slave of the Gods, and pawn of Frampt...",
        "12030102": "...I will kill you...",
        "12030103": "...And become the true Dark Lord...",
        "13000000": "Mm, you seem quite lucid! A rare thing in these times.",
        "13000001": "I am Logan. I'm a bit cooped up, as you can see.",
        "13000002": "I have a bright idea. Suppose you set me free?",
        "13000003": "I'm old and empty-handed, but I could repay you with knowledge,\nand sorcery.",
        "13000004": "This place is melting my mind. The inactivity is repressive!",
        "13000100": "Oh, heavens, thank you. I'm saved.",
        "13000101": "And, I'd love to resume my travels,",
        "13000102": "but I must log a few things first, and I owe you a favour. I will\nreturn to Firelink Shrine.",
        "13000103": "Speak with me there, so that I may impart my sorcery.",
        "13000200": "Oh, hello. Don't mind me. Go on ahead.",
        "13000201": "I'll be along later. Phoo-hah-hah, I'll be just fine, young one.",
        "13000400": "I fail to see your design,",
        "13000401": "but if you think I'm too old to defend myself,",
        "13000402": "perhaps some sorcery will change your mind!",
        "13000500": "Heavens...the folly of youth...",
        "13000501": "...I'm too old for this...",
        "13010000": "There you are. I was expecting you.",
        "13010001": "As promised, I will share my sorceries.",
        "13010100": "Hello there. You really are very diligent.",
        "13010101": "I quite understand. Study is invigorating!",
        "13010200": "Hello there.",
        "13010201": "Very well indeed. I'm pleased to share my sorceries.",
        "13010300": "Hello there. What have you been up to?",
        "13010301": "I thought that perhaps you'd gone Hollow on me.",
        "13010302": "So, have you come to further your study of sorcery?",
        "13010400": "Hello there. I was expecting you.",
        "13010401": "As promised, I will share my sorceries.",
        "13010402": "...",
        "13010403": "I am afraid that you are unable to learn sorcery.",
        "13010404": "The basic framework, you see. It cannot be taught.",
        "13010405": "Oh, do not fret. Life isn't all about sorcery. You will find your\nown way.",
        "13010406": "Don't frown with regret; peer forward with your head high.",
        "13010500": "Hello there. Glad to see you alive.",
        "13010600": "Hello there. Glad to see you alive.",
        "13010601": "Hmm...",
        "13010602": "It seems you've come quite a way...",
        "13010603": "Excellent. You are certainly ready. I shall teach you sorceries.",
        "13010700": "I will stay here for the time being.",
        "13010701": "Speak to me again to further your knowledge.",
        "13010800": "No results, eh...",
        "13010801": "Well, the way of sorceries is a long, hard road. Take it slowly.",
        "13010900": "Farewell.",
        "13011000": "Heading out, are you?",
        "13011001": "I, too, will leave soon. Undead or no, I shan't stay here\nforever.",
        "13011002": "...You have great potential. Don't go and die over nothing.",
        "13020000": "Hello again! What a chance meeting this is!",
        "13020001": "Alas, I'm imprisoned once again. I don't suppose you could stage\nme a getaway?",
        "13020002": "The Archives, such a storehouse of knowledge. So close, but just\nout of reach!",
        "13020003": "The thought offends me so, I could simply die!",
        "13020004": "As a student of the arts, you understand me, yes?",
        "13020100": "Oh, thank you very much. I'm saved.",
        "13020101": "That makes twice. I must be sure to repay you.",
        "13020102": "I will visit the Archives. If I discover any new spells, I shall\nshare them with you.",
        "13020103": "Prepare to be impressed, by the onward march of sorcery!",
        "13020200": "Hello. Don't mind me. Go on ahead.",
        "13020201": "I'll head out soon. I wish to lay down my plans before I visit\nthe Archives.",
        "13020600": "Hello there. I was expecting you.",
        "13020601": "This place is truly magnificent, more than expected, even.",
        "13020602": "As promised, I shall share the new sorceries with you.",
        "13020603": "And, the secret of Seath's immortality.",
        "13020700": "Hello there. You really are very diligent.",
        "13020701": "Oh, I understand. We are in the midst of a revolution!",
        "13020702": "Oh, hello there. Where have you been?",
        "13020703": "Time is a resource. Let's delve in promptly.",
        "13020800": "Oh, there you are, it has been a while.",
        "13020801": "Or, were you just here?",
        "13020802": "This fascinating place defeats my sense of time...",
        "13020900": "Come again.",
        "13020901": "The knowledge here is limitless. I will absorb it, then share it\nwith you.",
        "13021000": "Come again, any time you please.",
        "13021001": "For I too, learn, whilst teaching a student.",
        "13021100": "Farewell.",
        "13021200": "Mm...mm...",
        "13021201": "Mm...mm...",
        "13021300": "Ah, the secret of Seath's immortality?",
        "13021301": "If you have fought him, and were imprisoned, you must know that\nSeath is a true Undead, different from ourselves.",
        "13021302": "His wounds close promptly, and no mortal blow affects him,\ngranting true insulation from death.",
        "13021303": "It is an effect of the Primordial Crystal, a sacred treasure\npillaged by Seath when he turned upon the ancient dragons.",
        "13021304": "So, only by destroying the Primordial Crystal can you so much as\nscratch his hide.",
        "13021305": "And it so happens, the Primordial Crystal is in the inner garden\nof these very archives, the Crystal Forest.",
        "13021400": "The tomes stored in these Archives are truly magnificent.",
        "13021401": "A great pool of knowledge, the fruits of superior wisdom and an\nunquenchable desire for the truth.",
        "13021402": "Some would say Seath had an unsound fixation ...But his work is a\nbeautiful, invaluable resource.",
        "13021403": "All progress demands sacrifice.",
        "13021404": "And I certainly bear no antipathy for that wonderful scaleless\nbeast.",
        "13021500": "...Who are you...",
        "13021501": "...Stay clear...stay clear of my work...",
        "13021502": "...Curses upon you!",
        "13021503": "...How dare you disturb me!",
        "14000000": "Somebody! Please, let me out of here!",
        "14000001": "Somebody, anybody!",
        "14000002": "Help me! Unlock the door!",
        "14000003": "...Damn...",
        "14000004": "...I'm finished...",
        "14000005": "How did this ever happen...",
        "14000020": "Hello! Hello!",
        "14000021": "You, yes! You! I'm here, here!",
        "14000022": "I'm trapped! Please! I require assistance!",
        "14000023": "Try and open the door!",
        "14000040": "Brilliant! You opened the door for me!",
        "14000041": "Thank you; I am saved. I thought I might never escape.",
        "14000042": "I am Griggs of Vinheim. A sorcerer of the school.",
        "14000043": "I am much obliged for your assistance.",
        "14000044": "Thanks to you, I may now resume my travels.",
        "14000100": "Oh, hello.",
        "14000101": "I am fine. I will rest a while, then return to Firelink Shrine.",
        "14000102": "I have my sorcery. And I will be more cautious next time.",
        "14000103": "Besides, I have an important task at hand.",
        "14000200": "Ooph!",
        "14000220": "Eeg!",
        "14000240": "What on Earth are you...!",
        "14000260": "Cease! I implore you!",
        "14000300": "Curses, you leave me no choice!",
        "14000301": "You aren't yourself any more.",
        "14000302": "Forgive me!",
        "14000400": "Rrrg...",
        "14000401": "How could this...",
        "14010000": "Oh, hello.",
        "14010001": "I regret meeting you under such compromising circumstances.",
        "14010002": "At least we both made it back unscathed.",
        "14010003": "Incidentally, would you care to learn any sorceries?",
        "14010004": "You're clearly talented, and besides, I owe you.",
        "14010005": "Of course, we will require some materials, but I am happy to\nteach you some elementary spells. Are you interested?",
        "14010020": "Splendid! Very well!",
        "14010021": "I am pleased to have a chance to give something back.",
        "14010022": "Well, then let's get started straight away.",
        "14010040": "Yes, I see...",
        "14010041": "It is regrettable, but to each his own.",
        "14010042": "If you change your mind, do not be bashful.",
        "14010200": "Oh, hello.",
        "14010201": "Well, you certainly are keeping at it.",
        "14010202": "Myself? I am fine. Let's get started straight away.",
        "14010220": "Oh, hello.",
        "14010221": "What is it? Have you changed your mind?",
        "14010222": "I am praying that you will. For, I owe you my life.",
        "14010300": "Oh, hello.",
        "14010301": "Terrific to see us both in one piece.",
        "14010302": "And pray that you never go Hollow! ",
        "14010400": "Good-bye, then.",
        "14010401": "Do stay safe.",
        "14010500": "All right. That'll do it.",
        "14010501": "That should help you on your journey.",
        "14010502": "May we meet again.",
        "14010600": "Hm? What's that?",
        "14010700": "No matter. Let us continue.",
        "14010800": "Have you heard of Big Hat Logan?",
        "14010801": "Master Logan is a great sorcerer, and my teacher.",
        "14010802": "Both of us came to this land, as Undead.",
        "14010803": "But one day, he departed, leaving only a note.",
        "14010804": "...I suppose he wished to keep me out of harm's way.",
        "14010805": "But where does that leave me?",
        "14010806": "I have dedicated myself to sorcery.",
        "14010807": "But Master Logan could find no use for me...",
        "14010900": "Ahh, yes, the note that Master Logan left?",
        "14010901": "It only said he would travel to Anor Londo, by way of Sen's\nFortress.",
        "14010902": "I can only guess that he seeks the Regal Archives.",
        "14010903": "For Master Logan is a tireless pursuer of wisdom.",
        "14010904": "Wisdom trumps all; everything else is hogwash.",
        "14010905": "When the curse turned him Undead, I am certain that he only felt\nit was the perfect chance to visit this land.",
        "14010906": "I only wish that I had his courage...",
        "14011000": "I wish to do what I can to locate Master Logan.",
        "14011001": "I am aware of my shortcomings, but I cannot very well just sit\naround here and rot.",
        "14011002": "Oh, do not worry. I have considered our relationship.",
        "14011003": "I will only leave after I have taught you all the sorceries that\nI know.",
        "14011004": "I shall count myself lucky if I manage to locate Logan, or even\nreturn here in one piece.",
        "14011200": "Oh, hello again!",
        "14011201": "I was waiting to tell you...Master Logan has returned!",
        "14011202": "And he tells me that he has you to thank!",
        "14011203": "Well, we are both in your debt, now. Thank you, sincerely.",
        "14011204": "He's just over there. Go along and have a chat.",
        "14011300": "Oh, hello.",
        "14011301": "I appreciate the attention, but you really should speak to Master\nLogan.",
        "14011302": "That will certainly do you more good.",
        "14011400": "Have you spoken to Master Logan?",
        "14011401": "He is an accomplished scholar. The arts of sorcery would never\nhave come this far without his contributions.",
        "14011402": "And he has the nerve to go risking life and limb! What a stubborn\nold fellow.",
        "14011403": "Hah hah hah hah!",
        "14011500": "Have you ever cast one of Logan's spells?",
        "14011501": "Isn't it exhilarating?",
        "14011502": "As he sees it, there are no gods, no transcendence, only truth,\nand Logan only wishes to elucidate it.",
        "14011503": "It is this heretical methodology that allowed Logan to advance\nsorcery to the point that he has.",
        "14011504": "In a word, he is a hero. Despite the awful rumours.",
        "14011505": "Time will tell. The annals of history will prove dispassionate!",
        "14011600": "Oh, there you are! Just so you know...",
        "14011601": "Master Logan has left on his own again.",
        "14011602": "It seems that he is still determined to find the famed Regal\nArchives in Anor Londo.",
        "14011603": "And I have decided that I must search for him.",
        "14011604": "I intend to search for him. Only, before I leave, there is one\nthing I wish to do.",
        "14011605": "You see, Master Logan has left most of his books.",
        "14011606": "With them, I could teach you Logan's sorcery.",
        "14011607": "...You have done much to assist me.",
        "14011608": "Before I leave on this journey, I will teach you all that Logan\nhas to share.",
        "14011700": "Oh, hello, you made it!",
        "14011701": "Then, let us begin.",
        "14011702": "As promised, I shall bequeath Master Logan's sorcery to you.",
        "14011800": "It's not that I am concerned for Master Logan's welfare.",
        "14011801": "Even in this treacherous land, Logan's skills are unmatched. He\nis a true hero.",
        "14011802": "...No, the reason I seek Logan is...",
        "14011803": "...Well, it's really my own conceit, now isn't it?",
        "14011900": "Ohh! Master Logan is at the Archives?!",
        "14011901": "Thank the heavens; finally his wish has been granted.",
        "14011902": "I suppose he has his head buried in those tomes?",
        "14011903": "That is always what made Master Logan happiest...",
        "14011904": "Ahh, I can just imagine him now!",
        "14012000": "Oh, hello.",
        "14012001": "Why, of course I don't mind teaching you sorceries...",
        "14012002": "But now that you've located Master Logan,",
        "14012003": "I can't imagine that I can be of much help.",
        "14012100": "I have decided to seek the Regal Archives.",
        "14012101": "I realize that I may never make it.",
        "14012102": "But I would feel worthless if I did not at least try.",
        "14012103": "What other choice do I have to earn Logan's recognition?",
        "14012200": "Uwwah!",
        "14012220": "Heavens!",
        "14012240": "In the name of sanity!",
        "14012260": "Cease! Have you gone mad!",
        "14012300": "Damn...you've lost it, haven't you?",
        "14012301": "Then I have no choice.",
        "14012302": "Prepare yourself!",
        "14012400": "Rrrg...",
        "14012401": "Master Logan...",
        "14012500": "Did you see them?",
        "14012501": "The three young clerics...\nheaded for the Catacombs, to seek Kindling.",
        "14012502": "headed for the Catacombs, to seek Kindling.",
        "14012503": "Kindling is the art of feeding bonfires.",
        "14012504": "The poor young girl, sent down into a tomb.",
        "14012505": "What a terrible mission she is burdened with.",
        "14012600": "Two things are required for sorcery.",
        "14012601": "First, you must equip a wand.",
        "14012602": "Second, you must attune a sorcery.",
        "14012603": "Then you will be ready to fire away.",
        "14012604": "Oh and don't forget to aim!",
        "15000000": "So, it is thou who rescueth me?",
        "15000001": "Most gracious. I am deeply obliged.",
        "15000002": "I am Dusk of Oolacile.",
        "15000003": "I cometh from an age long before thine...I can not stay here for\nlong.",
        "15000004": "So, before I disappear, allow me to ask one thing.",
        "15000005": "My home, Oolacile, is the home of ancient sorceries.",
        "15000006": "My hope is to pass this profound knowledge to thee, with thine\napproval.",
        "15000007": "Would this be of assistance to thee?",
        "15000050": "My heartfelt thanks. I am pleased beyond words.",
        "15000051": "Then, I shalt engrave my signature.",
        "15000052": "If thou art in need, pray summon me from my signature.",
        "15000053": "It seems that my time is done. May the great flames guide thee.",
        "15000100": "Yes, of course...I understand well.",
        "15000101": "Pray forgive me. I have overstepped my boundaries.",
        "15000102": "Farewell; another age, another land, beckons me to return.",
        "15000103": "May the flames guide thee.",
        "15000220": "What dost thou...",
        "15000240": "Whatever for...",
        "15000260": "Cease this barbarism...",
        "15000300": "Ahh...",
        "15000301": "Farewell, my rescuer...",
        "15000500": "I am Dusk of Oolacile.",
        "15000501": "It is an honour to see thee again.",
        "15000502": "I shall follow thine wishes.",

        "26000903": "Why not try this? I've no use for it any longer.",
        "26001000": "Well!",
        "26001001": "That head of yours...Nothing seems to help, does it?",
        "26001002": "I still have medicine. Go ahead and use it.",
        "26001003": "Now, now, no need to fret about it.",
        "26001004": "Things will be fine, one day...",
        "26001100": "Oh, hello.",
        "26001101": "What is it that you need?",
        "26001200": "Oh, hello...A pleasure to see you again.",
        "26001201": "But don't neglect the Fair Lady. She needs some company.",
        "26001300": "In all honesty, I am envious.",
        "26001301": "What comfort can I offer, without speaking her tongue?",
        "26001400": "Worse than Undead, we are diseased, and unwanted.",
        "26001401": "Like the grime of the Great Swamp.",
        "26001402": "But my dear, Fair Lady! She cried for me...",
        "26001403": "And swallowed the great Blightpus, despite Mistress Quelaag's\norders to the contrary.",
        "26001500": "Hrgkt!",
        "26001510": "Erggkt!",
        "26001520": "Oog!",
        "26001530": "Hagkt!",
        "26001600": "I knew it! I knew it!",
        "26001601": "You will not get away with this!",
        "26001650": "You...you would betray us?!",
        "26001651": "I should have known!",
        "26001700": "Hrg...rgggkt...",
        "26001701": "My dear Fair Lady...You are in danger...",
        "26001800": "Why, youuuuu monster...!",
        "26001801": "The Fair Lady! What have you done, what have you done!",
        "26001802": "Hrggreeeeeeeeeeh!",
        "26001900": "Below us lies the ruins of the legendary city of Izalith.",
        "26001901": "There, the Molten Giant watches over the Flame of Chaos.",
        "26001902": "Our Fair Lady, and Mistress Quelaag, fled from the ruins.",
        "26001903": "I do not know the details...And I do not ask...",
        "26002000": "Have you heard of Lost Quelana?",
        "26002001": "An inhuman witch, who wanders the Poison Swamp.",
        "26002002": "Only no one has ever seen her, so who really knows?",
        "26002003": "But what if she is another of the Quelaag sisters?",
        "26002004": "Our Fair Lady would be greatly comforted by her presence.",
        "26002100": "Incidentally, do you have an interest in pyromancy?",
        "26002101": "Have you developed an interest in pyromancy?",
        "26002102": "If you have, I shall share my flame with you.",
        "26002200": "You have served our Fair Lady well.",
        "26002201": "Now, let this strength be yours.",
        "26002300": "...Well, fine. I will not force you.",
        "27000000": "Hmm...A mere Undead, yet you can see me? Fascinating...",
        "27000001": "I am Quelana of Izalith.",
        "27000002": "I am not often revealed to walkers of flesh. You have a gift.",
        "27000003": "Are you, too, one who seeks my pyromancy?",
        "27000004": "Like Salaman.",
        "27000020": "Yes, of course. It should be expected.",
        "27000021": "Very well. You shall be my pupil.",
        "27000022": "But to pursue my pyromancy, you must give something up.",
        "27000023": "Are you prepared to do this?",
        "27000040": "Hmm, very well. Then we are done.",
        "27000041": "You have spoken. Now away with you.",
        "27000060": "What? Considering my pyromancy?",
        "27000100": "Ah, there you are.",
        "27000101": "I was expecting you. Let us begin.",
        "27000120": "Ah, you again.",
        "27000121": "I applaud your diligence, but what have you brought for me?",
        "27000122": "I applaud your diligence.",
        "27000140": "Ah. It has been some time.",
        "27000141": "Truth be told, I thought you had perished.",
        "27000200": "No luck, hmm...",
        "27000201": "Well, young pupil, you must have patience.",
        "27000202": "Do not let it bother you.",
        "27000203": "But do not keep me waiting much longer.",
        "27000300": "Now, go.",
        "27000301": "Yes, now go.",
        "27000302": "Whatever you do, do not crack and go Hollow.",
        "27000303": "Don't you dare let yourself go Hollow.",
        "27000304": "Lest my time spent on you be wasted.",
        "27000320": "Ah, very well.",
        "27000321": "There is nothing left for me to teach you.",
        "27000322": "Our time together is done. It was short, but sweet.",
        "27000340": "Fool. Hurry along.",
        "27000342": "I can do nothing more for you.",
        "27000400": "Hm? What's the rush?",
        "27000500": "What was that? You are a peculiar one.",
        "27000640": "What is it! Fool!",
        "27000660": "Stop that!",
        "27000700": "Hmm...The voice of reason fails?",
        "27000701": "Then here is a lesson for you...",
        "27000702": "That you can only learn once!",
        "27000800": "Farewell, my mother, my sisters...",
        "27000801": "What have you done...",
        "27000900": "Long ago, I accepted another pupil, like yourself.",
        "27000901": "Over two-hundred years ago, there was a man, almost as bungling\nas you...",
        "27000902": "In your world he was called Salaman the Master Pyromancer.",
        "27000903": "The little rascal really made something of himself.",
        "27001000": "Pyromancy is the art of invoking and manipulating fire.",
        "27001001": "But remember one thing.",
        "27001002": "Always fear the flame, lest you be devoured by it, and lose\nyourself.",
        "27001003": "I would hate to see that happen again...",
        "27001100": "The Witch of Izalith?",
        "27001101": "...Please, do not speak of her.",
        "27001102": "...I abandoned my mother and sisters and fled to this land.",
        "27001103": "...Now I roam these parts, feigning ablution,",
        "27001104": "and pretending to seek answers.",
        "27001200": "...Hmm...",
        "27001201": "I have a favour to ask...",
        "27001202": "My mother, the Witch of Izalith, was one of the primeval Lords...",
        "27001203": "Her power came from the soul that she found near the First Flame.",
        "27001204": "...She focused this power to light a flame of her own, but she\nfailed to control it.",
        "27001205": "The Flame of Chaos engulfed Mother and my sisters, and moulded\nthem into deformed creatures.",
        "27001206": "Only I escaped, and now I am here.",
        "27001207": "But my mother and sisters have been in anguish since.",
        "27001208": "I beseech you. Free Mother and my sisters from the Flame of\nChaos.",
        "27001209": "I cannot do it myself; I lack the strength, and the bravery...",
        "27001210": "...But you...",
        "27001211": "I realize what I am asking. But please, free their poor souls...",
        "27001212": "Mother's ambitions were misguided, no doubt, but surely a\nthousand years of atonement is enough!",
        "27001300": "Outstanding...You have done very well.",
        "27001301": "Thank you. I am blessed to have met you.",
        "27001302": "I suppose I can call you fool no longer...",
        "27001400": "I can hardly thank you enough.",
        "27001401": "Please take this...It is all of me.",
        "28000000": "Well, this is a surprise. I don't get many visitors, except for\nghosts.",
        "28000001": "Do you have some business here?",
        "28000002": "My name is Ingward.",
        "28000003": "I'm an old man, bound to these parts.",
        "28000004": "But I don't mind a chat. I may even be of some help.",
        "28000100": "Well, this is a surprise. I don't get many visitors, except\nghosts.",
        "28000101": "Oh, cursed, are you? Is that what brings you to me?",
        "28000102": "It is a wise choice. Your troubles will soon be over.",
        "28000103": "My name is Ingward.",
        "28000104": "I'm an old man, bound to these parts.",
        "28000105": "But cleansing your curses; that I can do.",
        "28000106": "The breaking of curses is the territory of deities. You must be\nprepared to give some of yourself.",
        "28000200": "Hello again. How are you?",
        "28000201": "Oh, hello there. How are you?",
        "28000202": "I don't mind a chat. I may even be of some help.",
        "28000300": "Hello, there. Where have you been? I'm glad to see you well.",
        "28000301": "How can I be of assistance?",
        "28000400": "Well, hello there. Have you been cursed?",
        "28000401": "That can be quite onerous. But not to worry.",
        "28000402": "Such cleansing, I am happy to administer.",
        "28000403": "But the breaking of curses is the territory of deities. You must\nbe prepared for sacrifice.",
        "28000500": "Hello, there. Cursed again?",
        "28000501": "I do not know whether you are brave, or just foolish, but you do\nseem to find your share of trouble.",
        "28000502": "How do you manage to find so much trouble?",
        "28000900": "Hello there. What is it?",
        "28000901": "The key to the seal is now in your hands. I will help you in any\nway possible.",
        "28001000": "...You've broken the seal, have you?...",
        "28001001": "...",
        "28001002": "No, I have no regrets. My trust lies with you, and Frampt.",
        "28001003": "No, I have no regrets. For I trust in you.",
        "28001004": "But you cannot proceed without being able to traverse the Abyss.",
        "28001100": "According to legend, the knight Artorias crossed the Abyss,",
        "28001101": "and annihilated the atrocious Darkwraiths.",
        "28001102": "If you can find him, and learn from him, the Abyss may prove\nsurmountable.",
        "28001200": "...Magnificent. You defeated the Four Kings.",
        "28001201": "Impressive, even for a bearer of the Lordvessel.",
        "28001202": "And with this, my purpose is exhausted.",
        "28001203": "I have not seen the sun for a long time.",
        "28001204": "Perhaps I could do with a change...",
        "28001300": "Oh, hello.",
        "28001301": "The sunlight made me wince, and now I've come back to this dark\nhole!",
        "28001302": "So, what brings you here? I will help you in any way I can.",
        "28001400": "Oh, hello.",
        "28001401": "What is it? I will help you in any way that I can.",
        "28001500": "Oh, hello. You've acquired the Lordvessel, have you?",
        "28001501": "Very impressive.",
        "28001502": "I know exactly what your intentions are.",
        "28001503": "You seek the Four Kings whom I guard over.",
        "28001504": "And yes, I do have the key to the seal.",
        "28001505": "But before I give it up, there is something I must ask.",
        "28001506": "Do you see the great hall that stands before you?",
        "28001507": "Atop it, you will find a Darkwraith, a servant of the Four Kings.",
        "28001508": "Show me that you can defeat it.",
        "28001509": "As guardian of the seal, it behoves me to test your strength.",
        "28001510": "For if you cannot defeat the Darkwraith, you will be no match for\nthe Four Kings.",
        "28001511": "Even if Frampt has chosen you.",
        "28001512": "Even if you are the bearer of the Lordvessel.",
        "28001600": "Well, this is a surprise. I get few visitors, save for ghosts.",
        "28001601": "You have...the Lordvessel.",
        "28001700": "Oh, hello.",
        "28001701": "What is it? I will help you in any way that I can.",
        "28001800": "Hate to ask, really.",
        "28001801": "But I am the Guardian of the Seal. I have seen too many lives\nwasted over the eons.",
        "28001802": "So, I had no choice but to test your mettle.",
        "28001900": "You, you have defeated the Darkwraith!",
        "28001901": "Very good, indeed. I can certainly trust you.",
        "28001902": "This is the key to the seal.",
        "28001903": "The Four Kings slumber in the deepest chamber of the ruins.",
        "28001904": "Use this key to break the seal and open the floodgates.",
        "28001905": "...Oh, and do not forget...",
        "28001906": "The Darkwraiths reside in a dark void called the Abyss.",
        "28001907": "But the Abyss is no place for ordinary mortals.",
        "28001908": "Although long ago, the knight Artorias traversed the Abyss.",
        "28001909": "If you can find him, and learn from him, the Abyss may prove\nsurmountable.",
        "28002000": "I am the Guardian of the Seal.",
        "28002001": "I watch over the Four Kings, the masters of the Darkwraiths.",
        "28002002": "The Darkwraiths are the enemies of man, and any living thing that\nhas a soul.",
        "28002003": "They were born in New Londo, and that is where they perished; the\nentire city was sacrificed to contain them.",
        "28002004": "...For that is how great a threat they were...",
        "28002100": "New Londo was sacrificed to contain the Darkwraiths.",
        "28002101": "Mark my words. The Darkwraiths are the enemies of man, and any\nliving thing that has a soul.",
        "28002102": "They were never meant to roam again.",
        "28002200": "Long ago, the Four Kings were powerful men. Only, their hearts\nwere weak.",
        "28002201": "When an evil serpent dangled the art of Lifedrain before them,",
        "28002202": "they were unable to resist, and became pawns of evil.",
        "28002300": "What! No!",
        "28002301": "What are you doing!",
        "28002302": "Cease!",
        "28002303": "Stop that!",
        "28002304": "Sigh...",
        "28002305": "You are no different from the rest...",
        "28002306": "So be it! I am Ingward, the guardian of the seal.",
        "28002307": "Prepare to meet your doom!",
        "28002308": "Ohh...ogghh...How could I allow this...",
        "28002309": "Forgive me...my countrymen...",
        "29000000": "Well, you must be a new arrival.",
        "29000001": "Having trouble accessing the Undead Church?",
        "29000002": "Here, take this key.",
        "29000003": "I won't be needing it anymore.",
        "29000004": "I'm Andre, of Astora.",
        "29000005": "If you require smithing, then speak to me.",
        "29000100": "Well, hello again.",
        "29000101": "You seem to be doing all right.",
        "29000102": "Need anything forged?",
        "29000200": "Most weapons and armour are mighty sturdy indeed.",
        "29000201": "But every hunk of metal has its breaking point.",
        "29000202": "If you notice durability running low, it's time to repair.",
        "29000203": "You can ask a blacksmith like meself, or do it on your own with a\ngrindstone.",
        "29000204": "The nice thing about weapons... they never betray you.",
        "29000205": "So, pay them a little respect, eh?",
        "29000300": "There are two types of weapon forging. There's reinforcement, and\nthere's ascension.",
        "29000301": "Reinforcement is simple. It strengthens the weapon and nothing\nmore.",
        "29000302": "A simple task for any blacksmith. Hell, you could even do it\nyourself with a smithbox.",
        "29000303": "But ascension's a finer art. It alters a weapon's properties.",
        "29000304": "Ascension is the territory of we blacksmiths; a smithbox just\nwon't do the trick.",
        "29000305": "Start out with reinforcement. When that loses its charm, you can\nconsider ascension.",
        "29000306": "As you've noticed, this land is flush with the mad and wicked.",
        "29000307": "You won't make it through the night without employing my\nservices!",
        "29000308": "Hah hah hah!",
        "29000400": "You can forge armour just like you do weapons.",
        "29000401": "Reinforcement is easy enough. You only need a smithbox. But\nascension is the territory of we blacksmiths.",
        "29000402": "Forging armour is even easier than forging weapons.",
        "29000403": "Whether you forge weapons or armour first? Well, that's up to\nyou.",
        "29000404": "But nobody wants to see you go Hollow.",
        "29000405": "So, whatever you do, you'd better do it well!",
        "29000406": "Hah hah hah!",
        "29000500": "This is the old church.",
        "29000501": "It was abandoned in favour of the church that you passed through.",
        "29000502": "There are paths leading from here to two forbidden planes: Sen's\nFortress, and the Darkroot Garden.",
        "29000503": "They attract all sorts of lunatics, no-one as cultured as\nyourself.",
        "29000504": "It's fine to be Undead, but keep a level head, eh?",
        "29000505": "Hah hah hah!",
        "29000600": "Sen's Fortress is an old proving grounds built by the ancient\ngods.",
        "29000601": "It is the only route leading to the great Anor Londo.",
        "29000602": "Of course, most fools can't even find their way into that\nfortified deathtrap.",
        "29000603": "But they won't stop trying! Take that bumbling Sir Onion...",
        "29000604": "Hah hah hah!",
        "29000700": "Oi, where're you off to?",
        "29000800": "What's going on with you, eh?",
        "29000801": "I thought you'd gone Hollow there.",
        "29000802": "Hah hah hah!",
        "29000900": "Ow!",
        "29000950": "Owww, that hurts!",
        "29001000": "Well, you've got some nerve!",
        "29001001": "Coming at me like that!",
        "29001002": "I'll tear you to shreds! You bloody Hollow!",
        "29001100": "Curses, you damn backstabber...",
        "29001200": "Ahh, why, that's a fine ember you have there.",
        "29001201": "I could smith some mighty weapons with one of those.",
        "29001202": "Why not lend it to me?",
        "29001300": "I see...'Tis a pity...",
        "29001400": "Magnificent! You won't be disappointed.",
        "29001401": "I can hardly wait to get started...",
        "29001450": "Well, I'll be! That's a brilliant ember you've got there!",
        "29001451": "For all my years in the trade, that might be the finest!",
        "29001452": "How's about...you leave that ember with me?",
        "29001453": "I'm just an old smith. I'd give my left arm for a gem like that!",
        "29001460": "I see...'Tis a pity...",
        "29001461": "But perhaps you'd...",
        "29001462": "No, no, it's quite all right...",
        "29001463": "Quite all right, indeed...",
        "29001470": "Well! Thank you mightily for that.",
        "29001471": "Now, just leave the rest to me.",
        "29001472": "Andre of Astora gets the job done, you shall see!",
        "29001500": "My, that's a rare ember you have there.",
        "29001501": "I've seen one of those before...It's the ember of a divine\nblacksmith.",
        "29001502": "Might you consider leaving that with me?",
        "29001503": "I could produce divine weapons with a flame such as that.",
        "29001600": "I see...'Tis a pity...",
        "29001700": "Well, thanks for that!",
        "29001701": "You've made a fine decision. You soon shall see!",
        "29001800": "Oh, my, what a brilliant ember you have there.",
        "29001801": "I've only heard legends of such specimens...",
        "29001802": "The embers used for the secret rites of divine blacksmiths...",
        "29001803": "Perhaps you could lend it to me?",
        "29001804": "I've long dreamed of forging divine weapons...",
        "29001900": "I see...'Tis a pity...",
        "29001901": "I can't expect you to give up what's yours.",
        "29002000": "Ah-hah! Splendid, splendid! Thank you!",
        "29002001": "Andre of Astora never disappoints, I assure you!",
        "29002100": "Hrm? Show me that ember of yours...",
        "29002101": "Well, I've never heard of a black ember.",
        "29002102": "Hmmm...",
        "29002103": "How about leaving that ember with me?",
        "29002104": "I find it strangely fascinating..",
        "29002200": "Are you sure? Well, fair enough.",
        "29002201": "Tis a pity, but I'll live.",
        "29002300": "Yes, well! Thank you.",
        "29002301": "This ember really is something special. I'm already under its\nspell.",
        "29002302": "I sense great potential, indeed...",
        "29002400": "Hmm, that's an odd ember you have there.",
        "29002401": "Ahh, I know what you're thinking. But I'm no good with those.",
        "29002402": "It won't be easy, but...",
        "29002403": "I'm afraid you'll have to look for someone else.",
        "29002500": "I'll be seeing you, then.",
        "29002501": "Be careful out there.",
        "29002600": "Don't get yourself killed.",
        "29002601": "Neither of us want to see you go Hollow.",
        "29002700": "I know little of the Darkroot Garden.",
        "29002701": "Although I've heard rumours of a divine blacksmith who resides\nthere.",
        "29002702": "Those who get stumped in the Catacombs seek him for divine\nweapons.",
        "29002800": "Oh, yes, and one other thing about the Darkroot Garden.",
        "29002801": "It is said to house the grave of Sir Artorias the Abysswalker.",
        "29002802": "Only, of those who ventured into the forest, none has returned.",
        "30000000": "...Be gone with you!",
        "30000001": "...You'll spoil my focus.",
        "30000100": "...What's that, then? Need some smithing?",
        "30000101": "Then produce me some wares!",
        "30000300": "Well, what was that about?",
        "30000301": "Don't be coming around here without a good reason!",
        "30000400": "If that'll be all, then be gone with you!",
        "30000401": "...You'll spoil my focus.",
        "30000500": "Now where've you gone?",
        "30000600": "...You've got rotten manners.",
        "30000601": "If it be smithing you need, then produce your wares.",
        "30000700": "Bah!",
        "30000750": "You rotten scoundrel!",
        "30000800": "Trying to cause trouble, are you?",
        "30000801": "I am Vamos the blacksmith, and I'm no bag of bones!",
        "30000900": "Curses...",
        "30001000": "...Hmph? Why, is that...",
        "30001001": "...An ember from New Londo...",
        "30001002": "...And a fine ember it be...",
        "30001003": "What do you say? Why not leave it with me?",
        "30001004": "I'll give you a flame to feast your eyes upon.",
        "30001100": "Hmm, hmm, yes, yes, I see...",
        "30001101": "Well, do not hesitate if you should change your mind...",
        "30001200": "Yes, yes, very well! We'll get these old bones to work!",
        "30001201": "Keh heh heh!",
        "30001300": "...Hmph? Why, that's...",
        "30001301": "...an ember unlike any that I have seen...",
        "30001302": "...a very curious pattern...",
        "30001303": "...Could it be the flame of the legendary witch?",
        "30001304": "...I know! Suppose you left that ember with me?",
        "30001305": "Old Vamos would never let you down, no, not ever!",
        "30001400": "Hmm, hmm...Fine, then...",
        "30001401": "I doubt you'd even...bah, forget it...",
        "30001402": "These bones won't fail me anytime soon. I'll come across another,\neventually...",
        "30001500": "Keh heh heh heh heh!",
        "30001501": "Yes, splendid, splendid indeed!",
        "30001502": "...My, oh, my! You precious little thing...",
        "30001600": "...Hmph? Why, you have...",
        "30001601": "...an ember, do you?",
        "30001602": "Ahh, forget about it. I don't deal with that kind.",
        "30001603": "What has gone wrong with embers these days?",
        "30001700": "...Hmph! I'm here to smith, not to chit chat.",
        "30001800": "...I've told you, I'm here for the trade, not for the talk!",
        "30001900": "Enough with your presence. It disturbs me.",
        "30002000": "Well, you are a persistent one, are you not? ",
        "30002001": "But I'm afraid I'm a mere blacksmith, it's just me and my trade.",
        "30002002": "I would be of no help to a righteous warrior such as yourself.",
        "30002100": "I've told you, I have nothing to discuss...",
        "30002101": "If I have anything to offer, it's my smithing, and nothing more.",
        "30002102": "I'd be of more help with that ember from New Londo, of course...",
        "30002103": "It's a shame the whole place was flooded...",
        "30002200": "I've told you, I have nothing to discuss...",
        "30002201": "If I have anything to offer, it's my smithing, and nothing more.",
        "30002202": "Speaking honestly, I must say that I'm at my very limit. There's\nno more work to be done.",
        "30002203": "Ahh, unless I had the flame of that legendary witch...",
        "30002204": "But that would require a visit to Lost Izalith. Impossible...",
        "31000000": "Who are you?",
        "31000001": "Forge your weapons?",
        "31000100": "Mng. Hello.",
        "31000101": "Forge, I can!",
        "31000102": "Strong, I am!",

        "31000700": "Oi!",
        "31000701": "Stop that!",
        "31000800": "Angh, uggghh...",

        "31000901": "Shiny-shiny.",

        "32000000": "Hrm?",
        "32000001": "Well, this is unusual. You haven't lost your head.",
        "32000002": "And more importantly, you're free. How on earth...",
        "32000003": "...Well, I shouldn't pry.",
        "32000004": "I am Rickert of Vinheim.",
        "32000005": "I was once an established smith, but look at me now.",
        "32000006": "Can you believe it?",
        "32000020": "Hm? What is it?",
        "32000021": "Have you...Oh, no, don't worry. I've no intention of escape.",
        "32000022": "It's safe here. I can't bear the thought of going Hollow out\nthere.",
        "32000023": "Although, I must admit, I've not much to occupy myself.",
        "32000024": "How about this? I could forge your weapons, albeit with rather\nminimal tools.",
        "32000025": "I will show you what made me the best in Vinheim!",
        "32000030": "Hm? What is it?",
        "32000031": "Normally I wouldn't bother, but...",
        "32000032": "I must admit, I've not much to occupy myself.",
        "32000033": "How about this? I could forge your weapons, albeit with rather\nminimal tools.",
        "32000034": "I will show you what made me the best in Vinheim!",
        "32000100": "Oh, hello.",

        "32000150": "Oh, hello.",
        "32000151": "I was beginning to wonder when you'd come.",

        "32000400": "Hm? What's happened?",
        "32000500": "What was that about?",
        "32000501": "Ahh, it doesn't matter.",
        "32000660": "What's got into you!",
        "32000700": "Damn, you've gone Hollow, have you?",
        "32000701": "Forget about it! I have nothing more to say.",
        "32000702": "Be gone!",
        "32000703": "Oh, go away!",
        "32000704": "There's nothing here for you. Nothing at all.",

        "32000802": "...You've gone Hollow...",
        "32000900": "Hey, hang on...",
        "32000901": "That's a sorcery ember...isn't it?",
        "32000902": "Yes, it certainly is...The first I've seen since my banishment\nfrom Vinheim.",
        "32000903": "What do you say, friend? Mind giving that to me?",
        "32000904": "This is no-man's land. I'm the only one who could handle it\nanyway.",
        "32001000": "...Yes, I see. All right, fine.",
        "32001001": "But I don't think you're really seeing things clearly.",
        "32001100": "Yes, as you should!",
        "32001101": "I won't disappoint you. I'm taskless no longer!",
        "32001200": "Hey, hang on...",
        "32001201": "Is that...a sorcery ember?",
        "32001202": "I've never seen one like that, not even back in Vinheim.",
        "32001203": "What a brilliant flame!",
        "32001204": "Please, friend, let me have that. I am begging you.",
        "32001205": "I am a craftsman of Vinheim. I'd go Hollow before I pass up a\nflame like that!",
        "32001300": "...Fine.",
        "32001301": "...Fine, I won't bother you.",
        "32001302": "It was wonderful if only to gaze upon.",
        "32001303": "It takes me back to old times.",
        "32001400": "Oh, really! You are wonderful!",
        "32001401": "I will forge a Rickert masterpiece, just for you!",
        "32001402": "A weapon to make a legend out of you...",
        "32001500": "Hey, hang on...",
        "32001501": "Is that an ember?",
        "32001502": "Oh, no, I'm sorry. We of Vinheim don't deal in shoddy embers like\nthat.",
        "32001503": "Perhaps you should try an old smith out in the country.",
        "32001600": "Hm? What is it?",
        "32001601": "There's nothing to talk about.",
        "32001602": "We're both cursed; Undead. But what's there, really, to moan\nabout?",
        "32001700": "Old Big Hat? Of course I've heard of him.",
        "32001701": "Who hasn't in Vinheim?",
        "32001702": "He was a royal member of Dragon School, until he turned Undead.",
        "32001703": "I hear he was quite the character...Only, that was a hundred\nyears ago.",
        "32001704": "What interest have you in the old eccentric now?",
        "32001800": "Sorcery? Don't ask me how it actually works.",
        "32001801": "We only fiddle and forge, until it works itself in.",
        "32001802": "That's how we do it in Vinheim, at least.",
        "32001803": "We prefer to leave the theorizing to those uppity scholars.",
        "33000000": "Well, now...",
        "33000001": "You seem to have your wits about you, hmm?",
        "33000002": "Then you are a welcome customer!",
        "33000003": "I trade for souls. Everything's for sale!",
        "33000004": "Nee hee hee hee hee!",
        "33000100": "Oh, you again?",
        "33000101": "I hope you've brought plenty of souls?",
        "33000102": "Nee hee hee hee hee!",
        "33000120": "Oh, there you are.",
        "33000121": "Still keeping your marbles all together?",
        "33000122": "Then, go ahead, don't be a nitwit.",
        "33000123": "Never hurts to splurge when your days are numbered!",
        "33000124": "Nee hee hee hee hee!",
        "33000140": "Oh, there you are.",
        "33000141": "Where have you been hiding?",
        "33000142": "I guessed you'd hopped the twig for certain.",
        "33000143": "Bah, shows what I know!",
        "33000144": "Nee hee hee hee hee!",
        "33000200": "Hmph!",
        "33000201": "Cheap bastard.",
        "33000202": "If you're looking for a lot, you have to give a little.",
        "33000203": "Right, Yulia?",
        "33000220": "Tsk!",
        "33000221": "Throw me a bone, will you?",
        "33000222": "You haven't got much time anyway.",
        "33000223": "Right, Yulia?",
        "33000240": "Hmph.",
        "33000241": "What a waste of time.",
        "33000242": "Go and fall off a cliff. ",
        "33000300": "Thank you kindly.",
        "33000301": "Nee hee hee hee hee!",
        "33000320": "Ah, thank you, very much.",
        "33000321": "Come back soon!",
        "33000322": "Nee hee hee hee hee!",
        "33000400": "Hey, what! What's the matter?",
        "33000500": "What was that about?",
        "33000501": "Oh, nevermind.",
        "33000600": "Eeg!",
        "33000610": "Yeowch!",
        "33000620": "Oi, what's this about?",
        "33000630": "It's me! Stop it, I tell you!",
        "33000700": "You've gone mad, have you!?",
        "33000701": "I'll teach you! You lousy rat!",
        "33000702": "Yulia! Yulia!",
        "33000800": "Why, me...",
        "33000801": "Little Yulia...",
        "33000900": "Ah, this one? Ain't she lovely?",
        "33000901": "Her name is Yulia. She's plumb in love with me.",
        "33000902": "You'd never leave my side, now would you, Yulia?",
        "33001000": "Ah, you can forget it.",
        "33001001": "I'm all that she needs.",
        "33001002": "Careful, she'll bite your little fingers off!",
        "33001003": "Be kind, Yulia, be kind!",
        "33001004": "Nee hee hee hee hee!",
        "33001100": "Eh? My wares?",
        "33001101": "Of course they're stolen; what did you think?",
        "33001102": "And when you lose your head,",
        "33001103": "I'll sell it all again!",
        "33001104": "Nee hee hee hee hee!",
        "33001200": "Now, don't squander your time chatting!",
        "33001201": "You need to look over my wares!",
        "33001300": "Eh? I'm not here to chit-chat.",
        "33001301": "We talk business, or we talk nothing at all.",
        "33001400": "Things are getting treacherous in these parts.",
        "33001401": "A horrible goat demon has moved in below.",
        "33001402": "And up above, there's that humungous drake, and a bull demon,\ntoo.",
        "33001403": "If you stick around this place, it might end up being your grave!",
        "33001404": "Nee hee hee hee hee!",
        "33001500": "It's actually quite nice here, you know?",
        "33001501": "The Hollows don't care for a skinny old twig like me.",
        "33001502": "I've got Yulia...And nobody pelts me with stones anymore.",
        "33001503": "You're Undead, you know how it is.",
        "33001504": "I was treated worse back at home.",
        "34000000": "Hmm, you still have your senses about you?",
        "34000001": "Then why won't you buy some of my moss?",
        "34000002": "I need your souls!",
        "34000003": "Vee hee hee!",
        "34000100": "Oh, there you are, dearie!",
        "34000101": "A pleasure to see you again.",
        "34000102": "Vee hee hee!",
        "34000120": "Oh, there you are, dearie!",
        "34000121": "I have moss; now dish up some souls!",
        "34000122": "Vee hee hee!",
        "34000140": "Oh, hello, dearie.",
        "34000141": "You left me high and dry for a while, there.",
        "34000142": "I thought maybe you'd forgotten about me.",
        "34000143": "Are you back for more of my moss, then?",
        "34000144": "Plenty of it here. Freshly peeled, just for you!",
        "34000145": "Vee hee hee!",
        "34000200": "Drat.",
        "34000201": "What a humdrum lad you are.",
        "34000202": "What a humdrum lass you are.",
        "34000220": "Hmph, fine, then.",
        "34000221": "But you'll regret it.",
        "34000240": "Are you toying with me?",
        "34000241": "One day, your fate will catch up with you.",
        "34000242": "I have a sense for these things...",
        "34000243": "The Gods above are watching you!",
        "34000300": "Come again, if you please!",
        "34000301": "Vee hee hee!",
        "34000320": "Much obliged.",
        "34000321": "I think I like you!",
        "34000322": "Vee hee hee hee hee!",
        "34000400": "Don't run off!",
        "34000500": "What's the matter with you!",
        "34000501": "Don't you toy with my nerves!",
        "34000600": "Why, you!",
        "34000610": "Stop that!",
        "34000620": "Ouch!",
        "34000630": "Eeek!",
        "34000700": "What do you think you're doing?!",
        "34000701": "I have my pride, you damn fool!",
        "34000702": "You think you can get away with murder?",
        "34000703": "Yes, I suppose you think you're special!",
        "34000704": "Well, you're not! You're just another customer!",
        "34000705": "Burn! Burn in hell!",
        "34000706": "You cross-eyed Hollow!",
        "34000707": "There's no hope for anyone like you! The Gods will not have it!",
        "34000708": "Die! Die!",
        "34000709": "Die! Die!",
        "34000710": "Die a thousand times again!",
        "34000711": "Curses upon you!",
        "34000712": "Upon you, and yours,",
        "34000713": "for generations eternal!",
        "34000714": "All of you!",
        "34000715": "Eternal pain and suffering!",
        "34000716": "Lots and lots!",
        "34000800": "A curse upon you...",
        "34000900": "You've come to this land at a bad time.",
        "34000901": "There are nothing but Hollows in these parts. Save for me, of\ncourse.",
        "34000902": "You're Undead, too, aren't you? You be careful, then.",
        "34000903": "Vee hee hee!",
        "34001000": "I forage moss.",
        "34001001": "In the lower areas of this town, you'll find all kinds of poison\nand pestilence.",
        "34001002": "You can't travel a stone's toss without some trusty moss.",
        "34001003": "Make sure you take plenty with you!",
        "34001004": "Vee hee hee!",
        "34001100": "Ah, go down along the side to reach the depths of the Undead\nBurg.",
        "34001101": "Only unkempt crooks and liars to be found there.",
        "34001102": "Hardly a place for a lady like myself!",
        "34001103": "But who knows, maybe you'd fit right in?",
        "34001104": "Vee hee hee hee hee!",
        "34001200": "This is a wonderful place, don't you think?",
        "34001201": "We have water, moss, moisture, these nice iron bars...",
        "34001202": "I like it here, I really do.",
        "34001203": "Nothing good ever happened to me in life.",
        "34001204": "But now that I'm Undead, I've never been happier!",
        "34001300": "Tell me honestly...",
        "34001301": "You think I've gone to the other side, don't you?",
        "34001302": "That I've cracked my head and gone Hollow...",
        "34001303": "You do, don't you?",
        "34001304": "I can see it in your eyes.",
        "34001305": "You'd trust a patch of moss over me...",
        "35000000": "...Hrrg...",
        "35000001": "...Rrgggg...",
        "35000002": "...Rrrrrgggg...",

        "35000006": "...one, two, three, four, five, six, seven...argh...hrgggg",
        "35000007": "...Hrrgggggggg!!",
        "35000100": "...",
        "35000101": "Ah, what? What? Who are you?",
        "35000102": "Ahh, another Undead, eh? I took on Sen's Fortress alone...",
        "35000103": "But I'm no different from those vile creatures...I was driven by\nconceit...",
        "35000104": "Ahh, you think you're different? That you can handle it?",
        "35000105": "Yes, I remember that feeling. For I was the same.",
        "35000106": "...So, let me help you out. With your soul-searching.",
        "35000200": "...",
        "35000201": "Hm...Oh, yes, it's you.",
        "35000202": "What is it? Still something you need, eh, anything at all?",
        "35000203": "What is it?",
        "35000220": "...",
        "35000221": "Hm, ah, oh you?",
        "35000222": "Still alive? That's a surprise.",
        "35000223": "Anything you want? What's mine is yours, but at a price!",
        "35000300": "Nothing at all?",
        "35000301": "Fine then, rush in like a naked babe, and be skinned alive!",
        "35000320": "So, you're that good? Don't need a thing?",
        "35000321": "Bah. It won't be long, before you're begging for mercy.",
        "35000400": "Go along, try and make something of yourself.",
        "35000401": "But nothing will come of it. And I should know!",
        "35000420": "There you go, another brave soul.",
        "35000421": "But soon you shall see...You and I are no different...",
        "35000422": "Yes, yes, you soon shall see...",
        "35000423": "...the putrid fate we both share...",
        "35000500": "...Hmm?",
        "35000600": "...Hm, fine, fine. I understand.",
        "35000601": "I have my head about me.",
        "35000700": "Hrgro!",
        "35000720": "Hrgrah!",
        "35000740": "Hrgroah!",
        "35000760": "Hrgaw!",
        "35000800": "What the devil's got into you!",
        "35000801": "Hrrgrrrroooggh!",
        "35000802": "You hrggraaaghh!",
        "35000900": "Hrrggahh...",
        "35000901": "Ahhh...help me...",
        "35001000": "There's nothing more to say.",
        "35001001": "I'm finished. We're both on the brink, you see?",
        "35001002": "End of story. You bloody fool.",
        "35001100": "Let me give you a nibble of advice.",
        "35001101": "Don't even consider visiting Anor Londo. Not in your state.",
        "35001102": "For a century, they have tried, and failed.",
        "35001103": "The Knight King Rendal, Black Iron Tarkus, and even Logan\nhimself.",
        "35001104": "You won't stand a chance. You'll be eaten alive.",
        "35001105": "But, go along, if you wish. If only to deepen your despair!",
        "35001200": "Where do I get all my things?",
        "35001201": "Stripped off the corpses of fools like yourself.",
        "35001202": "It isn't easy. I have to catch them just before they go Hollow.",
        "35001203": "Don't worry. I'll be there to claim your trinkets. Gazing at your\nfinal twisted grimace!",
        "35001204": "Gee hee hee hee hee!",
        "36000000": "Aye, siwmae.",
        "36000001": "And good day to you.",
        "36000002": "I'm Domhnall of Zena.",
        "36000003": "I'm just, well, a peddler, of sorts.",
        "36000004": "I adore trinkets and oddities, so I trade for them.",
        "36000100": "Aye, siwmae.",
        "36000101": "We meet again.",
        "36000102": "Found anything special for my good self?",
        "36000103": "Mmm, I certainly hope so!",
        "36000200": "Aye, siwmae.",
        "36000201": "Never thought I'd see you here.",
        "36000202": "This feels karmaic. Pray tell, what do you have for me?",
        "36000300": "Aye, siwmae.",
        "36000301": "I didn't expect to meet anybody here.",
        "36000302": "I suppose great minds think alike, eh? Heh heh.",
        "36000400": "Thank you. That was a fine trade.",
        "36000401": "I have this funny feeling we'll meet again soon.",
        "36000402": "And we'll make another fine trade, of course!",
        "36000500": "Well, that is a shame, then.",
        "36000501": "But no matter. No, not to worry.",
        "36000502": "Come back again. I'm always available.",
        "36000503": "Not every trade was meant to be.",
        "36000504": "There'll be more in store for us, someday, sometime!",
        "36000600": "Hold on, there!",
        "36000610": "What's this about?",
        "36000620": "Now, stop that!",
        "36000630": "Ouch!",
        "36000640": "Oww!",
        "36000700": "What problem do you have now?",
        "36000710": "I'm a man of peace, idiot!",
        "36000720": "Enough of you, I say, farewell.",
        "36000800": "By the Lords...why...",
        "36000810": "My precious collection...",
        "36000900": "Hmm...",
        "36000901": "I'm afraid I don't see anything here.",
        "36001000": "Hmm...",
        "36001001": "Well, I'm certain we will make a good trade eventually...",
        "36001002": "So, I am willing to share some tips.",
        "36001003": "If you seek Kindling in the Catacombs, use divine weapons.",
        "36001004": "That will repel the reassembling skeletons.",
        "36001100": "Hmm...",
        "36001101": "Well, I'm certain we will make a good trade eventually...",
        "36001102": "So, I am willing to share some tips.",
        "36001103": "The cursed Ghosts of New Londo are formidable foes.",
        "36001104": "To face them, you will require special arms...Or a cursed body.",
        "36001105": "The quickest way to be cursed? Try the bug-eyed lizards in the\nsewer.",
        "36001106": "Desperate measures, to be sure...",
        "36001200": "Hmm...",
        "36001201": "You are a fine trading partner.",
        "36001202": "Rumour it may be, but I have heard of a surviving ancient dragon\nwho resides in this land.",
        "36001203": "A coterie of Undead serves the dragon, as they train to become\ndragons themselves.",
        "36001204": "Sounds unlikely, but you never know, do you?",
        "37000000": "Well, what do we have here? You must be a new arrival.",
        "37000001": "Let me guess. Fate of the Undead, right? Well, you're not the\nfirst.",
        "37000002": "But there's no salvation here. You'd have done better to rot in\nthe Undead Asylum... But, too late now.",
        "37000003": "Well, since you're here... Let me help you out.",
        "37000004": "There are actually two Bells of Awakening.",
        "37000005": "One's up above, in the Undead Church. The other is far, far\nbelow, in the ruins at the base of Blighttown.",
        "37000006": "Ring them both, and something happens... Brilliant, right?",
        "37000007": "Not much to go on, but I have a feeling that won't stop you.",
        "37000008": "So, off you go. It is why you came, isn't it? To this accursed\nland of the Undead?",
        "37000009": "Hah hah hah hah...",
        "37000100": "Hm? What, you want to hear more?",
        "37000101": "Oh, that's all we need. Another inquisitive soul.",
        "37000102": "Well, listen carefully, then...",
        "37000103": "One of the bells is up above in the Undead Church, but the lift\nis broken.",
        "37000104": "You'll have to climb the stairs up the ruins, and access the\nUndead Burg through the waterway.",
        "37000105": "The other bell is back down below the Undead Burg,",
        "37000106": "within the plague-infested Blighttown.",
        "37000107": "But I'd die again before I step foot in that cesspool!",
        "37000108": "Hah hah hah hah!",
        "37000200": "Bloody hell, what is it now?",
        "37000201": "You ask too many questions.",
        "37000300": "What's wrong? Get a bit of a scare out there?",
        "37000301": "No problem. Have a seat and get comfortable.",
        "37000302": "We'll both be Hollow before you know it.",
        "37000303": "Hah hah hah hah...",
        "37000400": "Why, what a surprise. I didn't expect you to make it.",
        "37000401": "...Oh, somebody rang the bell...Wait. Was it you?",
        "37000402": "You never give up, do you? I don't know how you do it.",
        "37000403": "Well, don't stop now. Only one more, but it's going to be\nsuicide.",
        "37000404": "Only one more now, if you have the heart for it.",
        "37000405": "Hah hah hah hah...",
        "37000500": "Did you see that hoity-toity cleric? He went through the\ngraveyard and down into the Catacombs.",
        "37000501": "Clerics speak of some nonsense called Kindling, used to feed\nbonfires.",
        "37000502": "They're so bloody determined. They practically queue to explore\nthe Catacombs.",
        "37000503": "Hah hah hah hah...",
        "37000600": "Have you been to the ruins of New Londo below?",
        "37000601": "Just head down the stairs, and take the lift.",
        "37000602": "It's certainly worth a visit.",
        "37000603": "It was once an Undead city. You may find a clue or two.",
        "37000604": "Unless the ghosts find you first...",
        "37000605": "Keh heh heh heh!",
        "37000700": "How did that silly sorcerer's apprentice end up?",
        "37000701": "You know, the one always prattling on about Master Logan.",
        "37000702": "He left for the Undead Burg, but never came back.",
        "37000703": "Serves him right. If even Old Big Hat can't make it out there,\nwhat chance does he have?",

        "37002102": "These ruins were probably too awkward for her.",
        "37002200": "Did you ring the second bell?",
        "37002201": "That is incredible, I must say...But now we have a new problem.",
        "37002202": "It's noisy, it snores, and its breath is lethal...",
        "37002203": "This is no laughing matter, I tell you.",
        "37002300": "Damn, that stench...And I was really beginning to like it here!",

        "37002402": "Oh, actually...Something strange did happen.",
        "37002403": "That crow flew off with somebody in its clutches. I think it was\na man curled up in a ball.",
        "37002404": "Stranger things have happened, right?",
        "37002405": "No, maybe not...",
        "37002500": "Hm? What now?",
        "37002501": "I'm not up for chatting. Leave me alone.",
        "37002600": "Well, what are you going to do?",

        "37002901": "I think you've done me a favour...",
        "37003000": "Now, that's just embarrassing.",

        "37003105": "You just need the right tools, or some powder.",
        "37003106": "If you keep swinging those scraps around, you'll be mistaken for\na Hollow!",
        "37003107": "Hah hah hah hah!",
        "38000000": "Mmm...",
        "38000001": "Hrmmmmm...",

        "38000104": "Quite honestly, I have run flat up against a wall.",
        "38000105": "Or, a gate, I should say. The thing just won't budge.",
        "38000106": "No matter how long I wait. And, oh, have I waited!",
        "38000107": "So, here I sit, in quite a pickle.",
        "38000108": "Weighing my options, so to speak!",
        "38000109": "Hah hah hah hah!",
        "38000200": "Still closed...",
        "38000201": "Still closed...",
        "38000202": "Mmm...",
        "38000400": "Yeeg!",

        "38000500": "That's your game, is it?",
        "38000501": "Well, I'm certainly not backing down!",

        "38000701": "Mm! Oh-hoh!",
        "38000702": "Ahh, where did you come from? Splendid news, I tell you.",
        "38000703": "First, I hear a great roar. And, voila! The path is open.",
        "38000704": "Just goes to show. Good things come to those who wait!",
        "38000705": "Hah hah hah hah!",
        "38000800": "Mn, mmm...Ah, so you see my plight?",
        "38000801": "Yes, indeed, I have run up against a wall.",
        "38000802": "...Or, a ball, to be precise.",
        "38000803": "...I'm afraid I'm a bit too plump to be outrunning those things.",

        "38000901": "...Bah, no chance. My head would spin.",
        "38000902": "Mmm...",
        "38010000": "Mmm...",
        "38010001": "Hrmmmmm...",
        "38010002": "Whatever can be done?",
        "38010100": "Ah, you again!",
        "38010101": "Let me guess. Were you repelled by the Silver Knights?",
        "38010102": "Aww, don't be ashamed. 'Tis the fate of vanguards like you and I.",
        "38010103": "I'll think of something. We can overcome this, together!",
        "38010200": "This is quite a fix...",
        "38010201": "We'll need another three, no, maybe five bodies...",
        "38010202": "Hmm...quite a fix indeed...",
        "38010300": "Mmm...mmm...",
        "38010301": "Mm! Oh-hoh!",

        "38020400": "Ahh, hello, there.",
        "38020401": "I'm going to take it slowly here, at least for now.",
        "38020402": "After all this time, it's not so intolerable.",
        "38020403": "I've actually become quite fond of it!",

        "38060402": "Well, you've saved me, once again...",
        "38060403": "Dear me, what can I say? I have failed you...",
        "38060404": "Hrgph...Aggkt...",
        "38060405": "My dear little Lin...",
        "38060500": "Hng...hng...",
        "38060501": "But, you! Didn't you get away?",
        "38060502": "Well, you've saved me, once again...",
        "38060503": "Thank goodness...I'm exhausted...",
        "38060504": "I think I'll have a rest.",
        "38060505": "Don't you worry, the ground below me is my pillow.",
        "38060506": "I'll recover shortly...",
        "38070000": "Well! Fancy meeting you here.",
        "38070001": "You did much for me up above. I am grateful.",
        "38070002": "You know, I was thinking...",
        "38070003": "The gates at the old fortress...",
        "38070004": "Was that your doing?",
        "38070020": "Yes! I knew it!",
        "38070021": "It seemed like an unlikely coincidence.",
        "38070022": "Well, am I fortunate! This knight of Catarina thanks you\nsincerely.",
        "38070023": "Please take this, as a token of my gratitude.",
        "38070040": "Is that so?",
        "38070041": "Hmm, no matter. Stranger things have happened.",
        "38070042": "Sometimes one only has to give it some time.",
        "38070100": "There you are.",
        "38070101": "I'll be heading down below shortly.",
        "38070102": "There's nothing worthwhile up above.",
        "38070103": "No worries! Adventuring is my life; I'm prepared for the worst.",
        "38070104": "Hah hah hah hah!",
        "38070200": "Hello, friend. Still holding up?",
        "38070201": "I owe you much. I was hoping that you would come.",
        "38070202": "So that I could say thank you, for saving me. From one brave\nknight to another.",
        "38070203": "Please, take this, as a token of my gratitude.",
        "38070204": "This is a relief. Now I have no regrets.",
        "38070205": "I shall depart for my final adventure...",
        "38070300": "Oh, hello, friend.",
        "38070301": "I am preparing for my final adventure.",
        "38070302": "Wherever you go, may you be safe.",
        "38070303": "You are a true hero, to be sure.",
        "38070400": "Oh, hello, friend.",
        "38070401": "...My daughter risked life and limb, just to find me...",
        "38070402": "...to deliver her mother's last words...And the poor girl's not\neven Undead!",
        "38070403": "Sigh...",
        "38070404": "Heavens, I never asked her to do that...",
        "39000000": "It was you who rescued me? Why, thank you.",
        "39000001": "I am Sieglinde of Catarina.",
        "39000002": "I don't know how I ended up in that crystal...",
        "39000003": "It wasn't terrible in there, but I could hardly move.",
        "39000004": "I must think of some way to repay you.",
        "39000100": "Oh! Have you seen my father?",
        "39000101": "You wouldn't miss him. A suit of armour, just like mine?",
        "39000120": "Thank goodness! I knew he was here somewhere.",
        "39000121": "Well then, now I must find him. Thanks again, truly.",
        "39000122": "Now if he'll just stay put, and keep out of trouble.",
        "39000140": "Yes, I see...But if you should happen to bump into him,",
        "39000141": "tell him that Sieglinde is on her way, and that he ought to just\nstay put.",
        "39000142": "And again, thank you kindly.",
        "39000230": "What in the...!",
        "39000240": "What the devil?!",
        "39000300": "Yes, now I see.",
        "39000301": "You are one of the bad ones.",
        "39000302": "Then, there's only one thing to do with you.",
        "39000400": "Oh, how can this be...!",
        "39000401": "...dear Father...",
        "39000500": "Rest assured. I will kill you as many times as it takes.",
        "39020000": "Oh, hello again.",
        "39020001": "We're both managing quite well, aren't we?",
        "39020002": "But I haven't found my father yet. Have you seen him?",
        "39020003": "Really! Then I must be off.",
        "39020004": "I'm sorry he's caused you trouble...He has a knack for that. If\nhe'd just stay put...",
        "39020005": "Yes, I see. Well, I had to ask.",
        "39020006": "I will continue searching a bit longer. Thank you so much.",
        "39020100": "Well, hello again!",
        "39020101": "I have finally located my father.",
        "39020102": "All of your help was invaluable to us...Thank you so much.",
        "39020103": "I was finally able to pass on my mother's last words.",
        "39020200": "My father? He went on his final adventure.",
        "39020201": "Don't worry, that's just the way he is. Undead or no. Sort of\nreassuring, really.",
        "39020202": "If he goes Hollow, I'll just have to kill him again.",
        "39030000": "My father...all Hollow now...has been subdued. He will cause no\nmore trouble.",
        "39030001": "It's finally over...I will return to Catarina.",
        "39030002": "You assisted us both greatly. I can hardly return the favour,",
        "39030003": "but please accept this. It's of no use to me now.",
        "39030100": "Oh, father...dear father...",
        "39030101": "Sob...",
        "40000000": "Oh? Still human, are you?",
        "40000001": "Then I am in luck. Could you help me?",
        "40000002": "As you can see I am stuck, without recourse.",
        "40000020": "I entreat you. Have pity on this powerless knight.",
        "40000021": "Surely you can imagine the depth of such dejection?",
        "40000040": "Please, I have duties to fulfil, and I will reward you\nhandsomely.",
        "40000041": "Well? I am certain you stand to benefit.",
        "40000060": "Why! You!",
        "40000061": "Do not run away! Hear me out!",
        "40000080": "Ahh, you have come back.",
        "40000081": "I beg of you. Help me.",
        "40000100": "Thank you, yes, sincerely.",
        "40000101": "I am Knight Lautrec of Carim.",
        "40000102": "I truly appreciate this, and I guarantee a reward, only later.",
        "40000200": "Yes, very sorry, your reward will have to wait.",
        "40000201": "I have just been freed. Allow me some time.",
        "40000220": "I am free. Now I can get back to work...",
        "40000221": "Keh heh heh heh...",
        "40000340": "Well, what have we here?",
        "40000360": "Keh keh keh. Are you sure about this?",
        "40000400": "You leave me no choice.",
        "40000401": "I was once grateful to you,",
        "40000402": "But if this is our fate, so be it!",
        "40000500": "You despicable...",
        "40000501": "...Curses...How could I...",
        "40010000": "Ahh, hello there.",
        "40010001": "I have your reward. Please accept it.",
        "40010002": "I am grateful to you. For freeing me...",
        "40010003": "Keh heh heh heh...",
        "40010004": "...Not enough for you? Well, let's not be greedy, now...",
        "40010005": "Keh heh heh heh...",
        "40010020": "By the Lords...Your face...",
        "40010021": "By the Lords...Your voice...",
        "40010022": "Hmmm... Your humanity is really slipping.",
        "40010023": "But there are methods. Most fools have more humanity than they\nknow what to do with.",
        "40010024": "Now, who do you imagine will make the best use of it, hmm?",
        "40010080": "Well, where have you been?",
        "40010081": "I am glad to see you are safe.",
        "40010100": "Hm, you again? What is it?",
        "40010102": "Our futures are murky. Let's not be too friendly, now.",
        "40010120": "Oh, hello.",
        "40010121": "I'm considering a change of location...",
        "40010122": "I have a rather, pressing matter to attend to up above.",
        "40010123": "That Keeper has served me well, but...enough with her...",
        "40010124": "Keh heh heh heh...",
        "40010140": "...You...",
        "40010141": "How dare you come prancing about!",
        "40010142": "I have nothing to say. Be gone from my sight.",
        "40010160": "Hello...I don't think we've met.",
        "40010161": "I am Knight Lautrec of Carim.",
        "40010162": "We are both Undead. Perhaps we can help one another.",
        "40010163": "Keh heh heh heh...",
        "40010180": "Hmm, what business do you have?",
        "40010181": "If you have none, then stay silent.",
        "40010200": "Ahh, you certainly are keeping busy.",
        "40010201": "Care to pay for a useful tip?",
        "40010220": "A wise choice, indeed.",
        "40010221": "Maiden Thorolund and her followers recently arrived in this land,",
        "40010222": "but she became stranded deep below the Catacombs.",
        "40010223": "Her followers either fled, or were reduced to Hollows...Leaving\nMaiden Thorolund all alone.",
        "40010224": "Not a bad tip, huh? A nubile cleric would be replete with\nhumanity...",
        "40010240": "Oh, really?",
        "40010241": "Well, suit yourself. Only trying to help.",
        "40010260": "Hm? That tip I gave you?",
        "40010261": "Ahh, I heard it from a fleeing old man.",
        "40010262": "That poor bastard! All his robes and trinkets won't help him now!",
        "40010263": "Kwah hah hah hah hah!",
        "40020000": "Why, you...How far will you come?!",
        "40020001": "...Please, leave me alone...",
        "40020002": "What have I done to you?",
        "40020003": "...Please, I beg of you...",
        "40020100": "Tsk!",
        "40020101": "You won't let me be?",
        "40020102": "Then I have no choice! You will regret this!",
        "40020103": "How dare you insult Lautrec the Embraced!",
        "40020104": "May the Goddess have Mercy upon you.",
        "40020200": "Well! You again?",
        "40020201": "Well, look at you.",
        "40020202": "I thought you were wiser, but I thought wrong!",
        "40020203": "Tis a terrible pity. Like a moth flittering towards a flame.",
        "40020204": "You fellows? No? Don't you agree?",
        "40020300": "So, here we go again!",
        "40020301": "Oh, look, another one!",
        "40020302": "How many times will these lambs rush to slaughter?",
        "40020303": "Well, let's get it over with.",
        "40020400": "Have you heard of Trusty Patches?",
        "40020401": "If ever a man has rubbed me up the wrong way, ugh!",
        "40020402": "If he ever comes around again, I swear, I'll have his hide.",
        "41000000": "I've heard all about you.",
        "41000001": "I'm Shiva of the East, captain of the brigade.",
        "41000002": "Let's teach you the clan basics now,",
        "41000003": "as there is no time to chat in the midst of fighting.",
        "41000004": "Except there's little in the form of rules, you hear?",
        "41000005": "Fight and hunt as you like. Whoever's fastest gets the prey.\nThat's the way we do it.",
        "41000006": "Only...Don't forget what Alvina said. Traitors aren't given a\nsecond chance, for any reason.",
        "41000007": "That's about it, then.",
        "41000008": "Don't worry, it's a good old time, isn't it?",
        "41000009": "Great to have you with us. Good hunting to you.",
        "41000100": "Ah, did you notice that one? Sharp eyes!",
        "41000101": "He's one of the clan. From the East, like myself.",
        "41000102": "Always slinking in the shadows, but he's a tough one.",
        "41000103": "You'll see what I mean.",
        "41000104": "Hah hah hah hah!",
        "41000200": "Don't worry, now.",
        "41000201": "You'll be called in soon enough.",
        "41000202": "Hunters with patience score the best kills.",
        "41000300": "Hrg!",
        "41000310": "Mnph!",
        "41000320": "Why, you dirty...!",
        "41000330": "Have you lost it?",
        "41000400": "Turning on us from the very start?",
        "41000401": "You have some guts, to turn on us!",
        "41000402": "Have a look at my sword, for it's the last thing you'll see!",
        "41000500": "Hiyaah!",
        "41000501": "Haaah!",
        "41000502": "Hiiyah!",
        "41000600": "You poor fool...",
        "41000601": "You won't be able to run far enough...",
        "41000700": "You sick Hollow...",
        "41000701": "Don't you ever come round again.",
        "41010000": "Hello again.",
        "41010001": "Strange to meet away from the clan and the forest.",
        "41010002": "But while you're here, how about some equipment?",
        "41010003": "I love collecting these things, but I can only keep so many.",
        "41010004": "And, you know, you are a friend. I'll sell them cheap.",
        "41010100": "We meet again.",
        "41010101": "I have the equipment, if you have the need.",
        "41010200": "Well, there you are again.",
        "41010201": "I've culled my best picks from my last summoning.",
        "41010202": "Have a look, will you?",
        "41010300": "I see you have a sharp eye for trinkets.",
        "41010301": "Suits me fine. I'll be seeing you.",
        "41010400": "Right then. I'll see you in the forest.",
        "41010500": "Right then. I'll be seeing you.",
        "41010600": "Have you heard of Chaos Blade?",
        "41010601": "The legendary sword of the ancient Undead master Makoto, its\nblade a swirling vortex.",
        "41010602": "I heard it's somewhere around here, but I can't find it.",
        "41010603": "...It's all I could ever wish for...",
        "41010604": "...I'd do anything to have it...",
        "41010700": "Why, look at you!",
        "41010701": "Just wait will you!",
        "41010702": "Your sword! Is it not... the Chaos Blade...?",
        "41010703": "I've been searching for her for ages!",
        "41010704": "...I beg of you, and I promise repay you...Will you give the\nsword to me?",
        "41010800": "Excellent! Much gratitude!",
        "41010801": "As promised, this is for you. Go ahead, take it.",
        "41010802": "Ahh, splendid, the Chaos Blade...Look into the\nvortex...Wonderful...",
        "41010803": "Simply wonderful...",
        "41010804": "Oh my, oh my...",
        "41010805": "But the sword's true value...hmm...",
        "41010806": "Can't be known without a good killing...",
        "41010900": "...Yes, quite alright, I cannot blame you.",
        "41010901": "The blade is yours, after all.",
        "41010902": "...So, I will do the honourable thing...",
        "41010903": "...And kill you for it...",
        "41011000": "Don't you run away! Be still you rat!",
        "41011001": "Taste my blade, taste it, you devil!",
        "41011002": "Hee hee!",
        "41011003": "Hee, hee hee hee!",
        "41011100": "This is what you get for crossing me.",
        "41011101": "Have a look at my sword, for it's the last thing you'll see!",
        "41011200": "Red...the colour of blood...",
        "41011201": "Hee hee...hee...",
        "41011300": "By the devils...",
        "41011301": "You won't be able to run far enough...",
        "41011400": "What a wonderful specimen...Like slicing through butter...",
        "41011401": "Hee, hee, nee hee hee!",
        "41011500": "Your ambitions have sealed your fate.",
        "41011501": "But, who'd have thought I'd be the traitor?",
        "41011502": "Sometimes you never know, do you...",
        "41011503": "Keh heh heh heh!",
        "42000000": "Good day! You look reasonably sane!",
        "42000001": "What are you doing in the Catacombs? Are you a cleric or\nsomething?",
        "42000020": "Yes, I imagined as much.",
        "42000021": "Best of luck with your pilgrimages or missions or whatever you\ndo.",
        "42000022": "This place is treacherous. Do watch your step, eh?",
        "42000023": "Heh heh heh...",
        "42000040": "No? Well, that's strange.",
        "42000041": "Ohhh, I know what it is. You've come for the trinkets, haven't\nyou?",
        "42000042": "Well, whatever it is...",
        "42000043": "This place is treacherous. Do watch your step.",
        "42000044": "Heh heh heh...",
        "42000100": "Yeah? What is it now?",
        "42000101": "Enough with the chit-chat. In a place like this, we need to stay\non our toes.",
